# StockLSTM: Time Series Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Networks

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict stock prices based on historical time series data. Using deep learning and sequence modeling, the goal is to capture long-term dependencies in stock trends to forecast future values with improved accuracy.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the dynamic, non-linear, and volatile nature of financial data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially LSTMs, have proven effective for sequential tasks like time series forecasting.

This notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing of historical stock prices
- Sequence generation for LSTM input
- LSTM-based model training
- Visualization of predictions vs actual prices
